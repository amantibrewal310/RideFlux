# RideFlux
A scalable, low-latency ride-hailing platform that supports real-time driver location streaming, sub-second rider–driver matching, trip lifecycle management, surge pricing, and payment processing. Built with stateless, horizontally scalable services using transactional storage for core data and in-memory caching for fast geo lookups. Designed to handle high concurrency, ensure atomic state transitions, and remain reliable across multi-region deployments. Includes monitoring, performance optimization, and a live-update frontend dashboard for ride and fleet visibility.
